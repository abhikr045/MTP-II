# Regression on MIT data + Transfer Learning for classification on UK data (as per UK device's LRC)
    'val' accuracy  = 88.65 % (old value during R&D = 86.18 %)
    'test' accuracy = 95.28 % (old value during R&D = 88.88 %)

# Regression on MIT data + Transfer Learning for classification on UK data (as per UK device's LRC)
  Inference with: Face blurred (gauss blur radius = 15 | 50 | 100)  |  face blacked out  |  only eyes blacked out  |  face+eyes blacked out before testing
    'val' accuracy  = 86.86 %  |  86.60 %  |  86.63 %  |  86.63 %  |  38.98 %  |  38.98 %
    'test' accuracy = 94.67 %  |  94.28 %  |  94.20 %  |  94.12 %  |  39.00 %  |  39.00 %

# Regression on MIT data (used the model trained during R&D) + Transfer Learning for classification on UK data
  TL training & Inference with: No blurring  |  Face blurred (gauss blur radius = 15)  |  face blacked out


NOTE - For above results, extractor = DlibHoG
TODO - Use RetinaFace for final approach
