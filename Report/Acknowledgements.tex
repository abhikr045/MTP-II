\acknowledgments

I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof. Sharat Chandran, for his constant encouragement and guidance. I would also like to thank my mentor Mr. Rahul Bishain for always helping me come up with new ideas and approaches to solve a problem. I would like to thank all my seniors, with a special mention of Aditya Modi, who developed the 3-Way app on which the 3-Wau dataset was collected. I would like to express my thanks to all members of ViGIL lab, my batch-mates and friends for their support throughout this journey.
